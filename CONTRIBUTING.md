# Contributing
## Development
1. Clone the repository.
2. Rename .git folders to make them usable:<br/>
    ```sh
    ./rename.py git
    ```
3. Install testing dependencies: 
    ```sh
    pip3 install pipenv==2022.8.30
    pipenv install --deploy
    ```
4. Run the development environment to experiment with new changes:
    ```sh
    rm -rf tmp tmp-ctfd/
    cp -R ctfd/data/ tmp-ctfd/
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up -d
    ```
5. Make the desired changes:
   * All services except CTFd are completely configured as code so desired changes should be made to the files in the appropriate folders.
   * To make changes in CTFd, use the [admin credentials](break-glass.md).

6. Shutdown the environment, move changes made in CTFd and rebuild it:
    ```sh
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml down
    ./apply.sh # save CTFd changes
    docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yaml up -d --build
    ```
7. Run tests:
   ```shell
   pytest -n 2 tests/
   ```
8. Rename .git folders to allow push:
    ```shell
    ./rename.py notgit
    ```
9. Commit and push!
